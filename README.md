## What is this app?
By tracking water intake and when you pee throughout the day, you get to know how long you were holding your pee for and if it is a matter of concern. Holding pee for long duration may led to health problems later on over the years.  [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCWEedgFNCk)
